# Weatherforecasting-using-Neural-Networks
 # Motivation
		Analsis of time series data. Here, weather forecasting data was used.However with minimal modification,
	  	the program can be used in the time series data from different domains such as finance or health care.
    	The goal is to predict temperature of the next 12 or 24 hours as time series data for weather forecasting was tested.
		Compare performance using mean square error and mean absolute error
